    hard_stop_distance: 0.35  # meters, hard stop distance for any obstacle
    max_linear: 0.5           # m/s, maximum linear velocity
    max_angular: 1.0          # rad/s, maximum angular velocity
    
    # Recovery parameters
    backup_duration: 3.0      # seconds, how long to back up during recovery
    backup_speed: -0.3        # m/s, backward speed during recovery (negative)
    rotation_speed: 0.6       # rad/s, rotation speed to find clear path
    stuck_timeout: 5.0        # seconds, time without movement before considering stuck
    recovery_timeout: 10.0    # seconds, timeout before retrying recovery
